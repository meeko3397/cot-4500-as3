This assignment shows what we learned in chapter 5 and 6, going over how to compute matrix operations,
and performing them on this project. This covers the use of Euler's method and Runge-Kutt, as well as
Gaussian elimination, LU Factorization. It also help determine whether the each of the matrix given was 
diagonally dominant or positive definite of their own respective matrix.
